# jens-office
These are possible designs for my new office, which I am making in place of the "recipes" project as my first one in the Odin project. I am more intersted in exploring possible office space designs that I am creating recipes. :-)
This will be a very basic HTML site. I will practice adding different elements, adding links (absolute and relative), and images.
